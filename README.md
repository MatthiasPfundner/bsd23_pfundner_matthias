# PRG1_06_Strings

This project is used to practise working with strings.
User input is read in as strings and encrypted or decrypted by rotating the individual letters and digits.
A selection menu consisting of **Encrypt text**, **Decrypt text** and **Quit** was implemented to select the modes.

---

## Installation

1. Download the program and save it to a location of your choice.
2. Open the command prompt and go to the previously defined folder structure in the **src** folder. 
3. Now start the program with the command `java Encryption.java`.

---

## Usage

### Encrypt text

The text encryption mode is selected by entering the number **1**.
First set the number of rotations and then enter the text to be encrypted.

### Decrypt text

The mode for decrypting text is selected by entering the number **2**.
The rest of the function is the same as text encryption, but rotated in the other direction.

### Quit

The program is terminated by entering the number **9**.
