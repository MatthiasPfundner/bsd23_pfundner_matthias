## Definition

The Markdown language, designed by John Gruber and first introduced in December 2004 with version 1.0.1, is a simplified markup language.

Its main goal is to provide a source form that is easily readable even before conversion.

To this end, Markdown mainly uses markup types that are common in plain text and emails.
